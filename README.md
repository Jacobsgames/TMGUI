# TMGUI

**TMGUI** is a clean, minimalistic, grid-based GUI toolkit written in C. It is designed for pixel-perfect interfaces, tile-based engines, and text-mode aesthetics. Inspired by old-school OS interfaces and fixed-layout systems, TMGUI emphasizes predictability, simplicity, and total layout control.

## Features

✅ **Tile/Grid-Based Layout**  
- Fixed cell dimensions (`cell_w`, `cell_h`)  
- Grid-rect based positioning with optional auto-placement (`AUTO`)  

✅ **Flat Layout System**  
- Supports `tm_vbox(...)` and `tm_hbox(...)` with deterministic cursor-based layout  
- No nesting — one container at a time  

✅ **Basic Primitives**  
- `tm_label(...)`, `tm_button(...)`, `tm_rect(...)`, `tm_text(...)`, `tm_drawtile(...)`  

✅ **Alignment Support**  
- Horizontal: `ALIGN_LEFT`, `ALIGN_CENTER`, `ALIGN_RIGHT`  
- Vertical: `ALIGN_TOP`, `ALIGN_CENTER`, `ALIGN_BOTTOM` (WIP)  
- Controlled via `tm_align(ALIGN(H, V))` macro  

✅ **Style System**  
- `tm_style` struct includes base styling + button states (`normal`, `hover`, `active`)  
- Per-widget style support using global `current_style`  
- Easily define reusable themes  

✅ **Canvas Abstraction**  
- `tm_canvas` system handles render targets, scaling, and screen centering  
- Optional transparency and scale-aware mouse input  

✅ **AUTO Layout Support (Minimalist)**  
- Use `AUTO` in any gridrect to auto-size/position elements  
- Width expands in `tm_vbox`, height expands in `tm_hbox`  
- Supports macros like `SIZE(w,h)`, `WIDTH(w)`, `HEIGHT(h)`, `AUTO`  

✅ **Simple GUI layout syntax**  
- Clean syntax for GUI layout:  
  
```c
tm_canvas canvas = tm_canvas_init(80, 45, false);
tm_canvas_begin(&canvas);

	tm_vbox(RECT(2, 2, 20, 0));
		tm_button("Play Game", AUTO);
		tm_set_spacing(2);
		tm_button("Options", AUTO);
		tm_button("Exit", AUTO);

		tm_align(ALIGN(CENTER, TOP));
		tm_label("Centered Title", SIZE(30, 1));

tm_canvas_end(&canvas);
```

✅ **No Dynamic Allocation**

No `malloc`s — all layout state is static and explicit.

✅ **Zero Dependencies Beyond Raylib**

- Pure **C99**
- **Raylib** handles rendering, input, and font loading

🛠️ **Planned Features**

- 🔲 Vertical alignment support for labels/buttons  
- 🔲 Scroll marquee for clipped label text  
- 🔲 Style inheritance per-widget  
- 🔲 Input widgets (text fields, sliders, checkboxes)  
- 🔲 Improved hover/click handling for grid-sized buttons
